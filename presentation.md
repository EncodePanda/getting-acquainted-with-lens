```haskell
data Conference = Conference
  { organizer :: Organizer
  , speakers  :: [Speaker]
  } deriving Show
```

---

```haskell

  , speakers  :: [Speaker]
  } deriving Show

data Organizer = Organizer
  { name    :: Name
  , contact :: Contact
  } deriving Show
```

---

```haskell
data Organizer = Organizer
  { name    :: Name
  , contact :: Contact
  } deriving Show
```

[.code-highlight: 2,5-9]

```haskell
data Organizer = Organizer
  { name    :: Name
  , contact :: Contact
  } deriving Show

data Name = Name
  { firstName :: String
  , lastName  :: String

# Getting things from a record
